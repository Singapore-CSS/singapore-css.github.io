5 years. 56 meetups. We've come a long way. It was nice to see many of you turn out for this last one. When Chris and I started this, we had zero expectations it would last this long. We don't know what the future will hold, but we hope that you will remember Talk.CSS fondly.

Thank you all for being part of this journey with us. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
