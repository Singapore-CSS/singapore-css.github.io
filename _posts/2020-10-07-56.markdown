This is it. Our 5th birthday and the last Talk.CSS. It hasn't been an easy year for many folks, and we truly appreciate all of you who have turned out for us over the years.

Hopefully along the way, you've found some of the things we've covered useful, perhaps picked up some Singlish along the way as well. Please join us for this final hurrah.

**Latest CSS news** by **Talk.CSS**  
Our no-longer-new regular segment which will cover latest updates in the realm of CSS and HTML.

**Design in the background** by **Eric Meyer**  
Our designs are filled with elements, and every element has its own background area, where a potentially infinite number of layers can be created. Eric will explore a number of ways to use that design space in ways both eye-catching and subtle.

**Introducing :is() and :where()** by **Daniel Tan**  
After many years, we're finally close to using :is() and :where() to simplify our selectors everywhere. Daniel shares what these pseudo-classes are all about.
